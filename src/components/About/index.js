          Hiya! I'm Leah. Welcome to my corner of the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
        I received my BFA in Graphic Design at DePaul University and graduated in June of 2019. I enjoy all aspects of design and am constantly looking for new ways to make beautiful things - the newest thing for me is studying full stack development.
        </p>
        <p>
        When I'm not designing, you can find me loving on my pets at home, having a Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings marathon on my couch, or curled up with a good book.
        </p>

          Feel free to reach out on my contact page if you enjoy my work!
